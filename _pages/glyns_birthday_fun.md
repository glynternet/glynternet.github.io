# Glyn's birthday fun 

### Helloooooo!

So you may know by now that I'm back in London and I'm finally settled (almost) again, so this year I'll be back to my birthday antics.  
The fun will be as follows, and I'd love it if you could make it to any or all of it! 

If you are able to attend any of them, please try to let me know so that I can make sure that you get all of the right messages when it comes to the days/events.

### Monday 2nd March - Actual Birthday: Unavailable
Tilly is taking me out: Sorry!

### Tuesday 3rd or Wednesday 4th March - _Club Austin: The Birthday Edition_
Austin Hill is an inspirational man, and the man who got me properly into board games. Club Austin is the board game night that I've started doing intermittently in London that some of you have attended, named after that very man. I will put on a night on either the Tuesday or Wednesday of the week, depending on which one is best for the bigger group of people.

### Thursday 5th March - [_Algorave_](https://www.cafeoto.co.uk/events/algorave/)

You may be thinking, "what's an algorave when it's at 'ome?". Well, let me tell you... Algorave is made from "sounds wholly or predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive conditionals". Expect a relaxed atmosphere and quick-fire sets from ambient to gabber and back.

### Friday 6th March - [_MATERIALS: Kode9 (140 Set), Forest Drive West, Sicaria Sound, Walton_](https://www.residentadvisor.net/events/1377250)

Gonna head for a night out on the town.  
Depending on the numbers for this one, I may book a table at Yadas on Rye Lane or may do something smaller beforehand if it's just a few of us.
