## Vegan rice cakes

EF Pro Cycling took down their vegan version of their rice cakes so I've pulled it from [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) and popped it here.

This vegan rice cakes recipe is a blank canvas. Delicious just the way they are, these chewy little cakes can also be jazzed up with any number of additions. Here are a few vegan add-in options to try:

- Cinnamon + finely chopped crystallized ginger
- Lemon zest + chopped dates + cashews
- Crushed salted roasted peanuts + cacao nibs
- Chopped almonds + toasted coconut flakes + diced dried apricots

A note about ingredients: Make sure you use creamed coconut, rather than coconut cream or milk. Creamed coconut is a creamy white semi-solid, typically sold in a block at the grocery store.

### Ingredients

- 4 cups water, 1000g
- 2 ¼ cups white short-grain rice, 500g
- ¾ cup creamed coconut, 200g
- 2 Tablespoons white sugar, 25.2g
- 2 Tablespoons coconut oil, 24g
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Method

In a rice cooker, combine water, rice, sugar, coconut oil and vanilla. Turn it on and leave to cook. Once the rice cooker has finished cooking, mix coconut cream directly into the warm rice. If you’re using any spices, fruit, chocolate, nuts or other add-ins this is the time to add them. Mix thoroughly.

Once cooled to room temperature, spoon the mixture into a large zip-closure freezer bag. Flatten, smooth the air out and leave to cool on a flat tray. Once cool, transfer to the refrigerator to set up overnight.

The next day, slide your rice cake slab out of the plastic bag and onto a cutting board. Cut into approximately 20 squares. You can either keep them all together in an airtight container, or individually wrap them in foil or Skratch Paper. They should be stored in the fridge until needed. Refrigerated, they’ll keep for three to four days.
