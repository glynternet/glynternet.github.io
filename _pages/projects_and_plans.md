## Making a bike mounted water tank

Wanted to mount a Nalgene to a bike.
Got quite a lot of inspiration from https://www.instructables.com/Make-your-own-bite-valve-hydration-system/.

### Components
- Nalgene cap found online, replacements are easy to find. When drilled in centre there's plenty of depth to not need to have some kind of panel gromet to prtect the tube. Shallower caps may need something.
- Food safe tube from RS components in UK.
- Check-valve to let air in but not let water out. I ended up getting an umbrella check-valve from an existing project but that was not a scable way to acquire one .
- Osprey bite-valve.

Possible valves for future, may be able to source them from minivalve:
- degassing valve, the thing used on coffee bad to let air out
- duckbill check-valve
- umbrella check-valve

Looks like nalgene cap size is a standardised thing, wide-mouth. May be able to 3d print something in future if needed.
