_"The Solstice Sprint is a 1000KM ‘checkpoints up front’ ultradistance bicycle race around the UK, starting and ending in Warwick(UK), set on the summer solstice. Riders must visit 10 checkpoints in order of 1-10, each checkpoint has a mandatory parcour, how riders get to each checkpoint is up to them."_

This race has both some flat bits and some very hilly bits.

## Pacing
I am racing, aiming to complete in 72 hours (hopefully faster) and will be totally satisfied if I even finish 😊

## Route

I've opted for a route that tends towards as short as possible whilst minimising hills.
