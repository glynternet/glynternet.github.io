# Forest of Dean & Black Mountains

## DAY 1

### FB01 - Butlers Mead to start of Black Mountains (80.6km, 1706m)
Lumpy the whole way.  
Pick up provisions in Monmouth

### FB02 - Up to Bothy (17.7km, 644m)
Mostly climbing  
Can try to eat near the start of this in the pubs.  
Fill up water in the pubs.

2 big descents, 1 big climb

### OPTIONAL EXTRAS

#### FB04 - Black Mountains loop (37.0km, 1272m)
If we end up with spare time to burn and have plenty of provisions we can do a loop from the Bothy

We can just carry on up the TransWales route towards the Kilverts Hills if we end up getting far within a short amount of time.

Joins to the TransWales route from Bikepacking book to make it back to LLanvihangel Crucorney

### FB06 - Bothy to Llanvihangel Crucorney via Hay Bluff (30.6km, 639m)
